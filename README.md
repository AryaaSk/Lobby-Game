# Lobby Game

## This project was to learn about THREEJS working with CANNONJS to create physics, and to also learn about creating multiplayer games which can support many people at once

Basically you just shoot using the mouse pointer, and try and impulse people off of the platform.

Controls:
- WASD to move 
- Press Q to toggle Shoot Mode

### <u>Shoot Mode</u>
In this mode you just click somewhere on the platform, or another player, and it will launch an impulse which will push the players around it away from it.
